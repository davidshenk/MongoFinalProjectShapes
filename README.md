## Shape Manipulation

- To create a new shape:
  1. Select the desired shape type.
  2. Provide the necessary details for the shape.

## 
```
The user should be able to:
Add a shape
Delete a shape
Update a shape
Get a single shape by id (not implemented in the front, use Postman instead)
Get all shapes of one type (not implemented in the front, use Postman instead)
Get all shapes in the system
Get a report of how many shapes there are for each type
```


## Important Note

Be cautious about potential errors as they may disrupt the server. Currently, there is no try-catch implementation in the backend.

Please handle errors carefully to ensure the stability of the server.
